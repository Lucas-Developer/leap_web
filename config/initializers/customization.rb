# Set customization stylesheets as the first asset path
#
# Some notes:
#
# * This cannot go in application.rb, as far as I can tell. In application.rb, the default paths
#   haven't been loaded yet, so the path we add will always end up at the end unless we add it here.
#
# * For this to work, config.assets.initialize_on_precompile MUST be set to true, otherwise
#   this initializer will never get called in production mode when the assets are precompiled.
